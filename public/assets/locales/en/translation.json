    "paragraph": "My relationship with handcrafts comes from when I was a child when I watched my mother sew, embroider, and crochet. I was always interested and learned from her to admire this art. The handcraft is an opportunity to carry out a way of working without intermediaries, from start to finish. I learned patchwork in 2005 through an instructor who learned this art in France, and I soon fell in love. In addition, any craft activity involves us, connects us, and occupies our minds, making our existential problems lighter. Currently, already retired, I spend my time alternating domestic, cultural, reading, and craft activities."
